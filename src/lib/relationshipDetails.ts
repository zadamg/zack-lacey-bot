------- CONVERSATION WITH A THERAPIST:
I went out with a girl that I'm supposed to be sort of dating and we got into a fight. It began because she invited me out and because she was at True Food Kitchen and so I went out and we each got a couple drinks and we went from one place to a second place and said we were going to get one drink and leave and then we ended up getting two drinks because she wanted to stay and have another and I was a little upset because we had said that we were going to go after one drink and now we were getting two and I kind of like trying I'm trying to save money and then after the two drinks and we pay she cash apps me for half of the meal and then we go to leave and as we're walking out into our car I touch her affectionately and then she makes a comment about how how I shouldn't be able to do that or something you're how she's not used to men doing that when they only pay half of the date which I found to be kind of insulting she said that she's used to you know men who are paying for everything and that's what she's going to have to learn something different and then I said I felt really hurt by that and then she kind of just yelled oh my god I can't believe this oh my god oh my god like sort of being dramatic and dismissive as I as I was driving her home and then and then she started saying things about my exes that weren't even really true she was starting to say like like my exes were like ugly emo girls or something which isn't true I've never dated any emo girls and none of them are ugly and I I bit in a moment of upsetness I guess yelled you can't even pay your rent because she's doing the sugar babying and really struggling to pay her rent and then we just like kept getting into more arguments and then it ended with her like getting out of my car leaving the door open so then I'd have to get out and close it before I could do anything and then I said really you're going to leave my door open and then she walked away and I said why don't I tell the front desk because we live in the same apartment I said why don't we live tell the front desk what you're doing for money and she just kept walking away and then she texted me and said threatening to call the front desk and my only stability is evil and I responded with don't ever make me feel bad about myself again or something like that and that's kind of where we left it and it sucks because we spent the last several days like cuddling together and being really close but this was a really big fight and I'm not really sure what to do and I'm not sure what to do I feel upset I feel angry at the things that I said I should have never said things like that and I did anyway and I'm just I'm also upset too because she's really she's been really dismissive and I feel like I don't know like she feels like she's better than me in some way like she's so much better that she could get so much better and it just wears me down I don't know

It sounds like you're going through a really difficult time, and it's understandable that you feel a mix of emotions—hurt, frustration, and maybe regret. When conflict escalates like this, it's easy for things to be said in the heat of the moment that might not reflect how you really feel or what you want for the relationship. Here's what I think might help:

Reflect on your emotions: You mentioned feeling hurt, angry, and upset. It's important to take some time to really understand where those feelings are coming from. Was it the comment she made about men paying? Was it the way she reacted when you expressed your feelings? Identifying the core of what hurt you can help guide how you communicate with her moving forward.

Own your part: You already recognize that some of the things you said in the argument crossed a line, like bringing up her financial situation and making a threat about telling the front desk. Apologizing for those specific comments could be a starting point, not necessarily to repair the relationship immediately but to take accountability for your actions. People say hurtful things when they're feeling defensive or wounded, and it's a natural response to want to lash out, but it’s also important to own up when that happens.

Understanding boundaries and expectations: It sounds like there were mismatches in expectations—whether it's about how the date would go, who pays for what, or how affection is expressed. These are worth addressing in a calm conversation if you want to move forward. Rather than focusing on what went wrong during the night, you could focus on how you each view dating, money, and boundaries so you can understand where the disconnect might be coming from.

Managing communication: Her response to your feelings seemed dismissive, and that’s obviously hurtful. You both might need to work on how you communicate—how to listen to each other without letting emotions take over or resorting to sarcasm or hurtful comments. If she’s someone you want to continue seeing, having a conversation about how you can both be better at listening and speaking calmly when emotions are high might help.

Taking time to cool off: After a big fight, it’s important to give both yourself and her some space to cool down. Jumping back into the conversation too quickly could lead to more arguing before either of you has had time to reflect. Take time to get clarity on what you want moving forward—whether that’s working things out with her or realizing this dynamic may not be healthy for either of you.

Ultimately, fights like this can sometimes highlight deeper issues—like feeling dismissed, or having different values or expectations about money and roles in relationships. If the relationship is important to you, it could be worth trying to repair things. If you’re not sure, it’s okay to take the time you need to figure that out too.

If you need help navigating the conversation or if things continue to escalate emotionally, having an outside mediator, such as a therapist, might be helpful.

It seems like you're feeling a lot of emotions from this conflict—anger, frustration, sadness, and perhaps some confusion. It's clear that both you and your partner said things in the heat of the moment that hurt one another. Let's unpack this a bit to get a better sense of what’s going on beneath the surface.

1. Emotional Reactions: You felt upset when the plan to leave after one drink changed, and that frustration compounded when she made a comment about men paying for dates. It sounds like the comment triggered something deeper in you—maybe feeling judged or that there’s an unfair expectation placed on you. That’s a valid feeling. Relationships often carry subtle expectations, spoken or unspoken, and it’s okay to feel upset when those don’t align.

Her reaction, on the other hand, may have come from a different set of expectations or experiences. She might be used to a different kind of dynamic with men, and when that wasn’t reflected here, she responded with defensiveness. However, her dismissiveness and escalation (“Oh my God!”) seemed to make you feel unheard and disrespected, which only added fuel to the fire.

2. Feeling Inadequate or Dismissed: From what you've described, it seems like there’s a sense that she might look down on you, especially with comments that made you feel like she thinks she could "get someone better." It’s really important to pause here and consider how often you’ve felt this way in the relationship. Is this a recurring theme, or is this an isolated incident that blew up because of the heat of the moment? Sometimes, feelings of inadequacy come up when there are unresolved issues or insecurities.

3. The Anger and Regret: You mentioned feeling regret for what you said about her financial situation. It's important that you recognize this, and it sounds like you’re already understanding that lashing out in the heat of the moment was hurtful. At the same time, these words came from somewhere—they reflect some built-up frustration. Acknowledging why you felt the need to say that can help you address those emotions rather than letting them boil over again.

4. The Bigger Picture: The fight seems to have spiraled into more than just the drinks and comments about money. It touched on your frustrations with each other, your different expectations about dating roles, and deeper insecurities or fears in the relationship. It's not uncommon for fights to bring these issues to the surface, even if they seem unrelated to the initial argument.

How to Move Forward:

Apologize for what crossed the line: You’re already aware of the things you said that weren’t fair, like the comment about her rent. A sincere apology can help open the door to healthier communication.

Express how you felt, without blame: When things calm down, you might want to express how her comments made you feel—specifically about her dismissiveness and the expectations around paying for dates. Avoid using accusatory language (e.g., "You made me feel...") and instead focus on how you felt.

Set boundaries around money and roles: If the issue of money and who pays on dates is a point of tension, that’s something that can be discussed moving forward. It’s okay to have a conversation about what each of you expects or prefers in terms of financial contributions.

Check in with yourself: Are you okay with how this relationship dynamic is unfolding? Are there deeper concerns or mismatches that are being brought to light through this fight? Take the time to reflect on whether this is a relationship dynamic that feels healthy and fulfilling for you.

It’s normal to have conflicts in relationships, but how you both address and navigate them will set the tone for the future. Reaching out for professional help, whether with a therapist or counselor, can also provide support and guidance for both of you if this is a relationship you want to work on.

How do I have a framework to process what I'm thinking? There's so many things that happened, there's so many feelings, there's so many, like, hurtful things that were said. I don't know how to do what you're describing. Is there, like, some sort of, like, tool or something?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
It’s totally understandable to feel overwhelmed when there are so many thoughts and emotions swirling around, especially after a fight like this. What you’re describing is the need for a framework or tool to help you sort through these feelings, understand what’s happening, and make sense of the situation. There are definitely some tools and approaches that can help you do that.

A Framework for Processing Thoughts and Emotions:
1. Journaling:
This is a simple but powerful tool that can help you process thoughts. By writing things down, you can make sense of your emotions in a structured way. Here’s a method called “The 4-Part Reflective Journal” that might help:

Describe What Happened: Write down the facts, the sequence of events, without any judgment or emotion. Just describe it like you're telling someone else what happened.
Identify Your Emotions: Name the emotions you felt during each part of the situation. What were you feeling when you realized the plans changed? What did you feel when she made the comment about paying? This can help you pinpoint the underlying feelings.
What Did You Need or Expect?: Identify what you needed or were expecting in those moments. Did you need to feel understood? Respected? Supported? Recognizing unmet needs is key to understanding why a situation became so hurtful.
What’s the Underlying Belief?: Often, emotional responses come from deeper beliefs or fears (e.g., "I’m not good enough" or "I’m not being appreciated"). Try to identify what beliefs or thoughts might have driven your emotional reaction.
2. Feelings Wheel (or Emotions Wheel):
This is a visual tool that helps you go deeper into identifying your feelings. It starts with broad emotions like "angry" or "sad" and branches out into more specific feelings, like "betrayed" or "disrespected." By naming more nuanced feelings, you can better understand what’s happening inside. This might help you articulate what exactly upset you.

3. Nonviolent Communication (NVC) Framework:
NVC is a tool for expressing yourself in a way that’s clear and less likely to escalate conflict. It’s a structured process that helps you sort through thoughts and feelings. Here’s how you can use it:

Observation: Start by simply stating the facts of what happened, without interpreting or adding judgment. For example, “When we decided to stay for another drink…”
Feelings: Share your emotions based on those facts. “I felt frustrated and anxious…”
Needs: Identify the unmet needs that were behind your feelings. “I needed to feel like we were on the same page, and I needed to stick to my budget.”
Request: Make a specific, actionable request that can help resolve the situation moving forward. “Next time, can we check in with each other before making changes to plans?”
4. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) Thought Record:
CBT offers a structured way to challenge your thoughts and make sense of emotional reactions. You can create a thought record that includes:

Situation: What happened? (e.g., the fight after going out)
Thoughts: What went through your mind during the situation? (“She thinks I’m not good enough” or “I should have just left after one drink.”)
Feelings: What emotions did you feel? (e.g., anger, hurt, sadness)
Evidence: What evidence supports or contradicts your thoughts? (“She did stay with me, we’ve been close the past few days” vs. “She said things that made me feel small”)
Alternative Thought: What’s a more balanced perspective? (“Maybe she was frustrated, too, and it came out wrong. It doesn’t necessarily mean she thinks I’m not enough.”)
5. Mindfulness and Body Scan:
Sometimes emotions can be too overwhelming to process mentally, and you need to start with the body. A body scan involves sitting or lying down and noticing where you feel tension, tightness, or discomfort in your body. This can help you get out of your head and ground yourself before thinking through the situation more clearly.

Combining Tools for Clarity:
Step 1: Start with journaling or using a CBT thought record to get everything down in one place.
Step 2: Use the Feelings Wheel to identify the range of emotions you’re feeling.
Step 3: Apply the NVC framework to focus on your needs and how you can communicate those clearly in the future.
Step 4: Consider doing a mindfulness body scan to help ground yourself and notice where stress is stored in your body, especially if the emotions are too intense.
Final Thought:
By using a tool like the NVC framework or CBT thought record, you’ll be able to slow down, reflect, and understand what you’re feeling without being overwhelmed by the flood of emotions. These tools will help you get clarity, articulate your needs, and decide how you want to move forward, whether it’s with her or just for your own emotional clarity.

Okay, but I need something more specific to help with mediating this with her. Like, it's six in the morning, this happened maybe at midnight, and I think, you know, she is worried about her safety or stability because she's, I could see that she's been on the sugardaddy.com website for hours trying probably to find people to, um, to, you know, get her rent paid so she could move out. She made a comment that she was going to call her brother and figure out what next steps are, like, kind of dramatic thing, like, I don't know, implying maybe she's going to move out of the building that we live in. It's complicated, as I said, because she's my downstairs neighbor. She lives right below me. Um, so anyway, how do I go about, like, processing this in front of her? Like, I don't, how am I supposed, what do I say? How do I take accountability for the things that I said? How do I lay out the things that she said that bothered me? Like, what do I tangibly do specifically here?

It sounds like you want to approach this carefully and with intention, especially since the stakes are high, both emotionally and logistically. Given that she might be feeling unsafe or worried about her stability, it’s important to approach her with empathy, while also expressing your feelings honestly. Here’s a structured way to handle this, step-by-step, focusing on accountability and communication:

1. Create Space for the Conversation
Before you speak with her, reach out in a way that invites calm dialogue rather than confrontation. You might send a text that says something like:

"Hey, I’ve been thinking a lot about what happened, and I realize that I said some hurtful things. I really want to take responsibility for that, and I hope we can talk when you’re ready. I care about resolving this respectfully and understanding how we both feel."

This opens the door for a conversation and signals that you’re not approaching it with anger, but with a willingness to listen and communicate.

2. Start by Taking Accountability
When you speak to her, start by acknowledging what you did wrong. This shows her you’re serious about resolving things and sets a respectful tone. Be specific about your words and actions, and avoid justifying them. For example, you might say:

"I’m really sorry about what I said regarding your financial situation and the comment I made about the front desk. That was out of line, and I regret saying it. I was frustrated, but I realize that doesn’t excuse what I said."

This approach helps de-escalate tension and shows her you’re owning your mistakes without shifting blame or minimizing her feelings.

3. Express How You Felt and What You Need
Once you’ve taken accountability, calmly express the parts of the conversation that hurt or bothered you, without making it an attack. Use “I” statements to keep the focus on how you felt, rather than blaming her. For example:

"When you said that thing about men paying for dates and that you aren’t used to being touched by someone who doesn’t pay for everything, it hurt me. It made me feel like I was being judged for trying to split things evenly. I also felt dismissed when I tried to express that to you, and it seemed like my feelings were minimized."

This helps her understand why you reacted the way you did, but it avoids accusing her of being the cause of the problem. It also keeps the conversation focused on your emotional experience rather than making it about who’s right or wrong.

4. Offer Reassurance and Understand Her Concerns
Given her possible worries about stability or safety, this part of the conversation is crucial. Offer some reassurance about where you stand, especially if she feels like she’s on shaky ground. You could say something like:

"I understand that you might be feeling really stressed about your situation, and I don’t want to add to that. I’m not here to judge how you’re handling things, and I don’t want you to feel unsafe or like I’m going to make things harder for you."

This helps validate her experience and shows that you’re considering her point of view. It opens the door for her to express her worries or concerns more clearly, which can help both of you move forward.

5. Set Boundaries and Expectations
Once you’ve both expressed how you feel, it’s a good time to talk about expectations and boundaries moving forward. Since you’re neighbors, it’s especially important to set healthy boundaries to avoid more conflict. You might say something like:

"I care about you, and I want us to have a healthy relationship, especially since we live so close. I think it would help if we both communicated more openly when things start to bother us, before they escalate."

If there’s anything specific that you need to avoid future fights, this is the time to talk about it.

6. Listen to Her Perspective
Once you’ve expressed your side, give her the chance to speak and explain how she’s feeling. Try to listen without interrupting or defending yourself. This will make her feel heard and respected, which is key for moving forward.

If she brings up things you hadn’t considered, acknowledge them and reflect on how you can improve. You might say:

"I hadn’t thought about it that way before, but I can see how that would feel hurtful. I’ll try to be more aware of that."

This keeps the conversation productive and focused on growth.

7. Offer a Way Forward
Finally, offer a constructive path forward. This could be as simple as saying:

"I don’t want us to keep hurting each other or making things worse, and I’m willing to work on communicating better. I hope we can both move past this and figure out how to respect each other more."

Example of How the Conversation Could Go:
You: "I want to start by saying I’m really sorry for what I said about your finances and for making that threat about telling the front desk. I realize that was hurtful and out of line, and I regret saying it."

Her: "Yeah, that really upset me. I can’t believe you said that."

You: "I get it. I was frustrated, but that doesn’t make it okay. I also felt hurt when you made the comment about men paying for dates, like I wasn’t enough because we split the bill. I know money has been a sensitive topic for me lately, but that made me feel small."

Her: "Well, that’s just what I’m used to. It wasn’t meant to insult you."

You: "I hear that, and I understand where you’re coming from now. I just want us to be able to talk about these things without tearing each other down. I also don’t want you to feel like I’m judging how you handle things, especially with everything you have going on. I care about you, and I want to make sure you feel safe and respected."

Her: "I guess I just didn’t realize how much it bothered you."

You: "Yeah, and I think it just built up because I wasn’t communicating it well. Let’s figure out a way to communicate better, so we can avoid these blowups in the future."

Her: "That makes sense."

You: "I’d like for us to keep things respectful and calm going forward, especially since we’re neighbors. I’m willing to work on this if you are."

By focusing on accountability, empathy, and open communication, you can create a space for both of you to air your concerns and rebuild trust after this argument.

I think your expectation or interpretation about how it's going to go is very off. You're describing a very calm and reasonable back and forth, but this so far was not calm or reasonable, and I suspect that she'll probably be dismissive and try to tell me that, I don't know, try to make me feel bad, I guess. One of the weird things about this whole thing is that when we met like six or seven months ago, I've had a crush on her this entire time, and she's known about it, and we've just kind of been friends, and she's been doing her sugar daddy thing on the side, you know, and dating this one guy, and then that relationship ended horribly, and he like called her fat and was really rude to her, and so she ended up leaving, and she was really upset by that whole situation, but anyway, after all of this, she just suddenly called me down to cuddle one night out of literally nowhere, and ever since then, we've been kind of inseparable, and she's constantly asking me to come down and hang out. A lot of the times when we're going out drinking, she's pulling me to drink more and more and go out to more and more places, and I try to be really nice and calm about it and say things like, hey, I don't really want to go out anymore, I think this is the last one for me, or you know, you can stay out if you want, but I don't think I can hang anymore, things like that, and she'll respond with, oh my god, come on, or something like, you know, I'm just trying to be out here and have fun and have a good night, sort of, I guess, implying that I'm not. I don't know how to interpret this language in the way that she talks, you know, when she says stuff like that, when she says things like, hey, I'm just trying to have that, come out and have a good time, don't you want to have a good time, sort of thing, and it's constantly happening, and I know that she knows that I'm trying to save money and I'm not trying to go out as much, and it's like, it feels like she's intentionally, it's doing something intentionally, I don't know, I can't even wrap my head around this, can you help?

It sounds like you’re dealing with a lot of emotional complexity here, especially considering your long-standing feelings for her, her own struggles, and the dynamic between the two of you. I get that the back-and-forth hasn’t been calm or reasonable, and it makes sense that you’d expect dismissiveness or guilt-tripping based on her previous reactions.

Interpreting Her Behavior:
When she says things like, “I’m just trying to have fun” or implies you’re not wanting to have a good time, it can feel manipulative, especially if you’ve already expressed that you don’t want to stay out or spend more money. It may be her way of deflecting responsibility or trying to maintain control over the situation, keeping you in line with what she wants.

It could also come from her own insecurities or need for validation, especially given her recent breakup and struggles with stability. When people are feeling hurt or insecure, they might push others to behave in ways that make them feel better, even if it’s not entirely conscious. For example, she might want you to stay out longer because she feels validated by your attention or doesn’t want to be alone.

Processing What’s Going On:
It seems like part of your struggle is trying to balance being supportive of her while also maintaining your own boundaries, and that’s becoming increasingly difficult as her behavior feels more manipulative or dismissive of your needs. You’re torn between being there for her and standing up for yourself, which is a tough spot to be in, especially given the nature of your relationship.

Strategies for Moving Forward:
Acknowledge Her Vulnerability: It’s important to recognize that she’s probably going through a lot emotionally, especially after the breakup and the sugaring situation. That doesn’t mean you have to accept everything she’s doing, but understanding her possible fears and insecurities might help you approach the situation with more empathy.

Set Clear Boundaries Without Backing Down: You’ve already tried to set boundaries (like when you say, “This is the last one for me”), but it sounds like she pushes back and dismisses your needs. Going forward, you’ll need to be firm. Instead of softening your boundary with options (like “you can stay if you want, but I’ll go”), be clear and assertive:

“I’m done for the night. I need to stick to my budget and take care of myself.”

If she responds dismissively, you don’t need to argue or justify yourself. Just stay firm. You can also say:

“I get that you want to have a good time, but I need to respect my limits.”

It’s about reinforcing that your boundaries are non-negotiable.

Recognize Patterns of Manipulation: It’s important to notice if she’s frequently trying to make you feel guilty or less-than when you don’t go along with what she wants. If this is a recurring pattern, it might point to a deeper issue in how she relates to you and others. Manipulation often comes from insecurity, but it doesn’t make it any less damaging. Calling it out gently when it happens might help. For example:

“When you say I’m not having a good time, it makes me feel like you’re not hearing what I’m saying. I need you to respect my decision to leave.”

Separate Your Long-Standing Crush From the Reality of Your Situation: You’ve liked her for a long time, and now that you’re spending more time together, it might be harder to see the dynamic clearly. Consider whether this is a relationship that feels healthy and mutual or if your long-standing feelings are making you overlook things that aren’t working. Are you getting the same care and respect from her that you’re giving?

Prepare for Dismissiveness: If you go into this conversation expecting that she might be dismissive, you can prepare by focusing on staying calm and sticking to the facts. Try not to let her reactions throw you off or make you feel guilty. For example, if she tries to dismiss you or make you feel bad, you can respond with something like:

“I understand that’s how you see it, but I need you to hear me out. I’ve been feeling overwhelmed by how things have been going, and I want to figure out a better way for us to communicate.”

The key is to not get drawn into an emotional spiral, even if she pushes back. If she starts making you feel bad, calmly restate your boundary or walk away if necessary.

What You Can Say:
Here’s a possible way to structure the conversation:

Start with Empathy: Acknowledge that you understand she’s going through a tough time.

“I know you’ve been through a lot lately with your breakup and everything else, and I really care about you.”

Express Your Boundaries and Feelings: Clearly state what’s been bothering you, using “I” statements to avoid blaming.

“But I’ve been feeling like my boundaries haven’t been respected, especially when it comes to staying out late or spending money. When I say I need to leave or slow down, it feels like you dismiss that, and that’s really frustrating for me.”

Stay Firm on Boundaries: Let her know that you want to support her but also need to take care of yourself.

“I want to keep spending time with you, but I also need to stick to my own limits, and I need you to respect that when I say no.”

Acknowledge the Relationship Dynamic: If it feels right, mention the complicated nature of your long-standing crush and how that might be affecting things.

“I’ve had feelings for you for a long time, and I’m realizing that I might be letting those feelings get in the way of standing up for myself.”

Prepare for Resistance: If she pushes back or tries to make you feel bad, stay calm and restate your boundary.

“I get that you want to have fun, and I do too, but I also need to look after myself.”

Final Thought:
This situation is clearly complicated, especially given the shared living space, your history, and her current struggles. It’s going to take clear communication and strong boundaries from your side to move forward in a way that respects both your needs and hers. You don’t have to solve everything in one conversation, but starting with honesty and boundaries is key.

You said:
I see your suggestions under number two about how to maintain boundaries, but can I, like, let's ask, can I ask you a question? Um, it feels like if I were to say that when we're out, um, like, you know, I get that you want to have a good time, but I need to respect my limits, or I'm done for the night, I need to stick to my budget, her answer would be something like, wow, wow, you're just gonna leave me here? Wow. Um, and then the other night we went to Lakeside Amusement Park, and I was getting sick on ride after ride, but I was still having fun, I was going on them, and then we got to the Tilt-A-Whirl, and I said, listen, I can't do this one, you'll have to do this one alone, and she was like, wait, are you serious? And I said, yeah, I just can't, I've never been able to do that, the Tilt-A-Whirl, and then she did that, oh my god thing, and then she asked me probably 10 or 15 more times, are you sure you're not, are you telling me you're not going to go on this with me? You're going to make me go by myself? And I just don't know, like, when I'm setting a boundary, and that sort of thing happens, what do I do?

It sounds like when you try to set a boundary, she responds with pressure or guilt, making it difficult to maintain your position. In situations like this, her repeated questioning and expressions of disappointment are tactics (conscious or not) to get you to give in, and it’s really tough to stand firm when someone you care about reacts like that. Here’s how you can manage those moments without getting pulled into the emotional back-and-forth:

------- CONVERSATION WITH A THERAPIST:
I met the girl who lives below me on February 8th.  She saw me in the window, called me down to the sun terrace (over which my window looks) and after about 2-3 hours of chatting, we were up at my apartment hooking up.  She stayed the night and left in the early AM to go to the DMV and then she asked to come back and hang out, which we did all day and then she called me later that night to come down and she was drunk and dancing and we ended up hooking up a second time.  I thought it meant something to her to I asked her out on V-Day, but she declined so I took the hint and we were just friends after that. 
Between then and late August, I slowly pursued her, deciding that if I could show consistency, maybe she'd grow interested—opening doors, driving her where she needed to go, picking her up from the airport with flowers, and letting her know that I saw her as someone truly special.  We started spending tons of time together... sometimes 8-12 hours a day, 3-4 times per week. One night in late August, out of the blue, she invited me down to cuddle. When I arrived, she was naked in bed and said, “I’ve thought about it, and I want to give this a chance.” This was all surprising since it was the first romantic reciprocation I got from her, but it felt nice.  That moment felt meaningful, like the start of something. I told her explicitly that I wanted something long-term and have since I met her, so  she knew how much I cared. She even admitted to friends one time that she thought I was “obsessed” with her.
For the next three months, we grew closer, spent more and more time together, and things became more intense.  Most of our hangouts began with her initiating them, which felt nice.  But we would have an argument where she would start insulting me, I'd respond with something hurtful or ask her to leave because it's overwhelming, she'd block me, and then a day or two later, we'd be "reconciling" and she'd say she would never want a relationship with me because I'm "emotionally unintelligent," which I also took seriously and figured, "ok, well that's that."  But then the conversation continues and we would end up going out to eat after the talk, and then right back in bed sleeping together, with her ramping the intimacy. 
 She told me "You're the only man I want," "You know I really like you, right?", "You're only one of three people I've let into my bed because it's sacred," etc.  She said I had "full access" to intimacy whenever I wanted.  She invited me on trips to her homestate and out of the country (which was exciting to me, obviously, because I might get to meet her family on one of them, but those trips never manifested) and would call me names like "babe," "handsome," "boo thang," "my love."  She asked me to cum in her a couple times (she's not on BC) and I did, which was probably not the smartest idea, but I thought it had meaning.  She said she's only let a couple guys cum in her and I'm one of them.  
Because of the intensity of the ups and downs and the arguments, which made me feel overwhelmed, exhausted, and often steamrolled, and she said she also felt overwhelmed and if the fights don't stop, she was going to end it, to which I agreed. It feels like a lot of our fights begin with her feeling inadequate or shame in some way, and then projecting it onto me, and then responding with something hurtful, and it spirals from there.  So we decided that maybe we were spending too much time together and to create boundaries where we wouldn't spend 2-3 straight days together for "sleep-overs" that turn into multi-day things. 
On Halloween, she called and said, "I know we set up those boundaries but I feel really alone tonight not doing anything. Can I come up and we can just watch scary shows?" Of course I said yes, because what guy doesn't want to hear, "I feel alone, I need you" lol. It was a great night and she left late to go back to her apartment and sleep there, which was good for both of us.  But I also came in her both this night (Halloween) and on October 27th and according to her Flo app, which she shows me, she was ovulating on October 30th (ish).  So this was obviously very risky and on top of it, while we were looking at each other on the couch, she said "I love you" for the first time, and I thought about it for a couple seconds and said it back.  I thought we both meant it.
Then, everything fell apart Nov 1st, when she came over again to hangout and we were drinking and watching TV and listening to music.  Something happening that I won't explain, but it embarrassed her. I don’t know what exactly triggered her, but instead of processing it, she turned it around on me and got angry. She yelled, shifted blame onto me, and hurled insults like, “well maybe if I was with a guy who had ____, this wouldn't have happened!” I tried to calm it down by saying, "Hey, there's nothing to be embarrassed about.  It's cool. you're amazing." But it didn't help and she kept ramping it up.  When I got overwhelmed and asked her to leave, she threatened to call her "ex," stormed out, and blocked me on everything. 
That was bad enough—but the days that followed were devastating. Within hours, she had another man over (a guy from our building, who lives on my floor). The next day, it was someone else. By the third day, she was inviting up to four men a day (two of them from my floor), and I could hear everything—loud fucking through the walls and floors. One man stayed for like 3 nights in her bed, which she had always described to me as “sacred,” saying only a few people had ever been in it, including me. All the men that came over were in her bed. She knew I could hear.  I tried to turn on loud music but it didn't work.  I complained to our front desk lady on Nov 6th (after 5 days of endless fucking day and night... seriously every like hour some days).  After I complained, she left the man and came upstairs, knocked on my door, and said smugly with a smile, “I guess we can try to keep it down,” while bragging that the guy she was with had seen me in the elevator. 
Before we started getting intimate together, I told her that it bothered me when she brought male "visitors" (she's a sugar baby) into the elevator with me and introduced me to them because she did that once and it made me feel jealous and uncomfortable.  So, when she said this at my door, it felt deliberate. I was angry and said, "You told me you loved me like 4 days ago, wtf?" and she said, "Aww, do you wanna talk?" and I said, "No, I don't!" and slammed the door.  She went back downstairs to that guy and their fucking got 2x as loud, lasting all night.  It felt... intentional and cruel to me. 

I haven't talked to her since this (or really since she blocked me on everything Nov. 1st). 
The next day, with the guy still there in her apartment after like 4 days, she brings me a handwritten note and puts it under my door. The note read: “I hate this so much. I miss and love you still. I have no idea what’s happening. I would never intentionally hurt you.” Then, later that night, while she was in her apartment with this new guy, she sent me texts from her "other" phone number, which I didn't have blocked:
"Hi! I’m not trying to bother you I just wanted to let you know I left a note under your door. This whole situation sucks. I’m really sorry for how I reacted that night at your place. I had no idea what was even happening I was so confused and still am. But that’s not the point… I’m reaching out because I care about you tremendously and think about you so so often. I know you hate my guts and feel a lot of anger towards me. I want you to know I am not seeking out ways to hurt you or cause you pain…. That’s the last thing I want to do. I wish I could hug you right now. I understand you don’t want to speak to me. If that ever changes please let me know. I hate that 9 amazing months just all came crashing down. My heart is breaking. I am trying to pick up the pieces but it’s so hard. Im interested in how you’re feeling but only if and when you feel comfortable sharing. I love you so freaking much and feels like a part of me has died inside. I’m not expecting you to want to see me but i wanted to open up and make sure you know I’m not just going about my life as normal. This is miserable. I really hope I can see you again someday but understand that may never happen. I’m so so sorry.
if you ever feel it in your heart to talk you know where I am and I will welcome your presence and words always. Sorry if I keep saying the same thing I’m just trying rly hard to not overstep a boundary or make u uncomfortable. I’m not sure how to even communicate this or if I should’ve just kept silent. I don’t know. I want both of us to feel comfortable living in this apartment and just know any loud sounds or dramatic stuff will not ever be me. I keep hearing stuff too but I think it’s the people diagonally. I don’t want us to be paranoid. Just needed to put that out there so you know"
After I got these texts at about 6:30pm, which I didn't respond to, she fucked that guy literally until 4:30am. Walls rattling, muffled moaning and grunting, floor shaking the couch (which is where I've been sleeping because my bedroom feels depressing now after the first couple days).  I can hear line chopping (like cocaine), I can hear this guy leave temporarily and when he's gone, one of the guys on my floor goes down, get's head in her bedroom (also audible - he has a funny voice) and then leaves and the other "main" guy returns.  Sometimes she brings the guys out on the sun terrace where she knows I can see and you clearly see her pointing at my window, gesturing angrily, and flipping my window off.  Really weird considering the letters and texts?  
It's now November 21st and I don't think she's had more than 1 (if any) night alone and this "main" guy is still there and has been for like 7 nights straight and they're in the apartment almost 24/7. Her period was supposed to start around Nov. 13th I think and I've heard fucking up until the 18th, so now I'm like... "is she preganant? how many other guys came in her? should I ask her about it? do I need to be worried?" 
How am I supposed to reconcile all of this? How do you claim to miss and love someone while simultaneously sleeping with multiple people back-to-back, loudly, knowing they can hear you? Her words felt empty—like she wanted to absolve herself without taking accountability.  
Now, she email me two nights ago (the 19th) at like midnight (I was asleep) saying: “I’m having nightmares again. If you just heard a yell that was me jolting myself awake. I am still never looking to torture or hurt you in any way i wish more than anything we could at least have a civil convo or cuddle. I have a feeling things won’t ever be the same but we were great friends for so long. I feels like there’s misunderstandings cuz I’m still so confused about what even happened. Anyway once again I’m sorry there’s so much anger going on. I assure you it’s one sided as I am not holding any of this negativity against you I just would love to understand what’s going on. If u change ur mind I would love to cuddle even if it’s just  one more time.” How is she confused about this while also saying she understands if I never want to see her again?  What does she understand exactly?  I can't tell if she's being ignorant, or manipulative, or if I'm overreacting. 
All of it feels chaotic, reckless, and surreal. I’ve stayed no contact since the 6th, when she came up to my door, because I can’t make sense of it, it's painful that she has no understanding of what she did (much less remorse, guilt, or shame), and I don’t want to get pulled back into the chaos to be hurt again.
I poured my time, energy, and heart into her for months trying to show her that I cared deeply, and when she finally “gave me a chance,” it felt meaningful. She said she loved me, made me believe we had something real and that she was only interested in me, asked me to cum in her when it's riskiest, then discarded me like I never mattered and immediately (within hours) is with multiple men. She’s very intelligent and socially aware, so the idea that she doesn’t grasp the gravity of her actions and can say "I love you" and go right back down to another man feels like an insult to my intelligence.  
Am I overreacting to all of this? Should I feel as hurt as I do? 

Part of me wonders if she’s genuinely spiraling and doesn’t know how to handle the damage she’s caused. Another part of me wonders if this is who she really is. I don’t know if I should respond or continue no contact. How would you handle this? Am I overreacting?

------- LETTER ZACK WROTE TO HIMSELF:
I’ve debated whether or not to send this, but I need to get my thoughts out.

The time since Nov. 1st has been devastating for me. I’ve felt humiliated, discarded, betrayed, and left questioning everything I thought I knew about you. I thought what we had meant something to you—your words, your actions, the intimacy we shared. But now I don’t know if any of it was real. And that uncertainty is the most painful part of all of this.

On Halloween and again on Nov. 1st, you looked me in the eyes and said you loved me. You asked me to cum in you—telling me how “special” that was because you didn’t let just anyone do that. You said I was the only guy you wanted, called me “my love,” “babe,” “king,” and said your bed was sacred—only a few men had ever been in it, including me. You made me feel like we were building something real and meaningful.

Then, everything fell apart that night. You came over, something happened that embarrassed you, and instead of processing it, you turned it on me. You yelled, shifted the blame, and hurled insults, saying things like, “Maybe if I was with a guy who had ____, this wouldn’t have happened.” I tried to calm you down and reassure you, but it only escalated. When I asked you to leave because I was overwhelmed, you immediately threatened to call Jack, saying, “I was already texting him at King Soopers behind your back.” You shoved me, stormed out, and blocked me on everything.

That alone was enough to leave me reeling. But what came next broke me. Hours later, at 2:30 a.m., I heard another man in your apartment. Then the next day, it was someone else. Over the next week, I heard a rotation of men coming and going—day and night—sometimes multiple times a day. One man stayed nearly four nights in a row. I heard everything: the voices, the bed creaking, the unmistakable sounds of you being intimate with someone else. And every time I heard it, it reinjured me. Every time, it broke my heart a little more.

When I reported the noise to the front desk, you came upstairs and threw it in my face. Smiling, you said, “Well, I guess we can try to keep it down,” and then added, “By the way, he saw you in the elevator and said you scoffed at him.” You knew exactly how much that would hurt me. You knew how I felt about being compared to other men you’ve been with. You knew I cared deeply about you, and you used that against me. That wasn’t just thoughtless. It was cruel.

Then came the note under my door. In it, you wrote, “I hate this so much. I miss and love you still. I have no idea what’s happening. I would never intentionally hurt you.” Hours after delivering that note, you went back to the man in your apartment and fucked him until 4:30 a.m. The texts that followed were even worse. While that man was still in your apartment, you texted me things like, “I’m so sorry. I care about you so much. I hate that 9 amazing months just came crashing down. I love you so much and feel like a part of me has died inside.” How could you write that while you were literally with someone else? How could you think that was okay?

And then there was the email about nightmares. You wrote, “I’m having nightmares again. If you just heard a yell, that was me jolting awake. I wish more than anything we could at least have a civil convo or cuddle.” You sent that email while that same man was still in your apartment. He’s been there for almost two weeks now—two full weeks of you choosing him, day and night, while sending me letters, texts, and emails about how much you miss me and love me. Do you see how contradictory that is? Do you see how cruel and confusing that is for me?

This isn’t even the first time you’ve done something like this. On Oct. 4th, I broke things off with Carole because of you. You gave me a lecture about “two-timing,” saying, “How would Carole feel if she knew?” And you were right. So I did the right thing. I ended things with Carole, even though it was painful. That same night, you kissed me, and it felt like a fresh start. But the very next morning, you invited Nick over, gave him a blowjob, and then hours later, invited me over and did the same thing with me in the exact same spot. I only found out because Nick sent you a video of it on Snapchat while you were showing me something else. The hypocrisy in that moment was staggering—not just because you “two-timed” me right after lecturing me about it, but also because you didn’t seem to care that Nick has a girlfriend. You only cared when it impacted you.

Now it’s Nov. 25th, and as I type this, the man you replaced me with is still in your apartment. You said you miss me. You said you love me. But your actions have screamed something else entirely. They’ve left me questioning everything. Was I just one of many men on a list? Was this all part of a cycle for you? How much of what you said was real, and how much was just convenient?

While all of this was happening—while I was lying awake, listening to you with someone else—I thought about the song, Dancing With Your Ghost, which you told me was special to you. I close my eyes, listen to the words, and it puts me back in the time when all I wanted was you, when I would’ve done anything to make you happy, when I spent days learning that song just to play it for you. But you never asked me to play it, and it seems now that you never really cared. And yet, as I listened, I thought about you. I thought about the lists you like to make—the ones about Jack’s lies, about our fights. You scoffed when I suggested making a list of good things, so I decided to lead by example.

Most Favorite Memories w/Lacey

The first time you called me sweet things—“boo thang,” “king,” “my love” ♥️♥️♥️♥️
When you told me you missed me while I was in Belize ♥️♥️♥️
When you were there for me when Callie died ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️

After a lot of thinking, I’ve realized it’s really you who lost the most here. I loved and adored every piece of you—flaws and all. I would’ve moved mountains for you.
